# Introduction

This project is a personal portfolio site built with `Next.js (App Router) and TypeScript`, designed to showcase development skills and projects.
It is styled as a VS Code workspace and deployed on Vercel, emphasising clean, maintainable code structure and modern frontend best practices.

The main goal is to create a responsive, performant portfolio with well-organised code and an automated deployment workflow.

<br/>

# What Works (Implemented)
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Dark/Light theme toggle with Tailwind CSS
- Dynamic sidebar and tab navigation
- Global state management with Redux Toolkit + Redux-persist
- LocalStorage-based tab state persistence 
- Reusable component library (Badge, Icon, List, etc.)
- Deployment via Vercel

# Known Issues & Solutions

## LocalStorage-based tab state is not shared across components ([Realated PR](https://github.com/Narae-H/portfolio-2025/pull/15/commits/5ba624134a7ae50b597332c9ce5301b797f8180b))

Initially, the tab state was stored in `localStorage` for persistence.  
However, because React components read from `localStorage` independently, state updates weren't reflected across components, causing inconsistencies.

### Solution: Use Redux Toolkit with redux-persist for global state management

- Manage tab states globally via `Redux Toolkit slice` keyed by storage keys.
- Persist Redux state to localStorage using `redux-persist`.
- This ensures all components share and react to the latest tab state instantly.
