  "overviewContent": "Bootstrap has been leveraged to efficiently develop responsive web applications across multiple projects, particularly when rapid development was needed or design intervention was minimal. Pre-built components and the flexible grid system allowed consistent layouts, while predefined media queries ensured smooth adaptation across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Customising Bootstrap themes enabled alignment with project-specific requirements, resulting in interfaces that were both functional and visually coherent.",
