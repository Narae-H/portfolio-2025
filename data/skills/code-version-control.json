  "overviewContent": "Version control practices have been applied using Git and SVN to maintain code quality and enable seamless collaboration across teams. Branching strategies were established to support parallel feature development, while code reviews and conflict resolution processes were managed to ensure stability in shared repositories. GitHub Projects and issue tracking were adopted to align development tasks with project milestones, providing transparency and accountability within the team. Through disciplined source control and workflow management, large-scale applications were delivered with reduced integration risks and improved maintainability.",
