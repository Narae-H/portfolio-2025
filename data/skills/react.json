  "overviewContent": "Focusing on building responsive single-page applications (SPAs) with React, I manage state using hooks and apply best practices to ensure clean, maintainable code. My work includes performance optimisation such as lazy loading and code splitting to deliver smooth and efficient applications. While React is a relatively recent addition to my toolkit, I have actively applied it in portfolio projects and continue to expand my proficiency, emphasising reusable components, modular architecture, and scalable design patterns.",
