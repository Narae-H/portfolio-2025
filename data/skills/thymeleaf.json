  "overviewContent": "I possess a background in Thymeleaf as a template engine in Spring-based applications. I use it to create dynamic, server-side rendered web pages that integrate seamlessly with back-end logic. My work includes implementing forms, handling conditional content, and managing error messages within Thymeleaf templates, ensuring efficient and maintainable code. This experience has been particularly valuable in server-side rendering projects, where improving SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), achieving faster loading times, and enhancing security are essential.",
