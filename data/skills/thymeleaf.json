  "overviewContent": "Thymeleaf has been used to efficiently generate dynamic, server-side rendered web pages, integrating smoothly with back-end Spring logic. Templates were leveraged to handle forms, conditional content, and error messages, enabling maintainable and structured code. This approach enhanced SEO, improved page load performance, and strengthened security. By utilising Thymeleaf alongside Spring Boot, data from the server could be seamlessly rendered and reused across views, making front-end development faster and more consistent across multiple applications.",
