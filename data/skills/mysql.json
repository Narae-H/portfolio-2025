  "overviewContent": "MySQL was used to design and manage relational databases, ensuring high performance and data integrity across applications. This included writing complex queries, creating and optimising stored procedures, and structuring data for efficient retrieval. By applying best practices in indexing and query optimisation, database performance was enhanced, supporting dynamic, real-time features such as traffic estimation calculations and reporting. Collaboration with DBAs ensured accurate data modelling and smooth integration with backend systems.",
