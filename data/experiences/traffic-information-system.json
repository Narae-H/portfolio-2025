  "overviewContent": "I developed a new traffic information system specifically for the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, creating a dedicated website that provided real-time updates on estimated travel times for attendees. This system was designed to assist both domestic and international travellers by offering crucial information on traffic conditions and travel routes. By referencing the existing traffic information infrastructure, I enabled users to plan their journeys effectively and make informed decisions about travel to the Olympic events.",
