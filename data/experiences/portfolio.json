  "overviewContent": "The portfolio project was designed as a comprehensive personal profile, serving both as a showcase of my skills and a learning tool for honing React expertise. A primary focus was on creating custom components, enabling me to build a personal component library instead of relying on pre-existing ones. This approach provided valuable hands-on experience and reinforced my React skills. Additionally, I incorporated new dependencies to broaden my technical exposure and applied responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing across all devices. The project combines functional design with a strong emphasis on continuous skill development in full stack development.",
